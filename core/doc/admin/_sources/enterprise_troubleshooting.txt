Enterprise Troubleshooting
==========================

When you have problems with your ownCloud Enterprise installation, refer to 
:doc:`../issues/index` to see if you can resolve your issue 
without opening a support ticket. If you need to open a support ticket, use the 
Open Ticket button in your account on 
`<https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud/>`_.

Bug reports and trouble tickets usually need a copy of your ownCloud server 
configuration report. Use the **Enterprise license key** app on your ownCloud 
Admin page to generate the report with the click of a button.

The app automatically obscures passwords and secrets.
